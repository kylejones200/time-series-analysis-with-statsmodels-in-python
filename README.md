# Time Series Analysis with statsmodels in Python

This project demonstrates time series analysis using the statsmodels library in Python, including ARIMA modeling, Holt-Winters exponential smoothing, decomposition, and stationarity testing.

## Configuration

Edit `config.yaml` to customize:
- Data generation parameters (if using synthetic data)
- Model parameters (ARIMA order, seasonal periods, etc.)
- Which analyses to run
- Output settings

## Caveats

- By default, the script generates synthetic data. To use your own data, provide a CSV file with 'date' and 'value' columns via `--data-path`.
- The ARIMA model requires sufficient data points for reliable results (recommended: 100+ observations).
- Stationarity tests assume the time series has sufficient length for meaningful statistical inference.
